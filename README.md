# remark

Terminal-first code review notes for Git repos.

`remark` renders diffs for your working tree and lets you attach **line comments** that are saved as **git notes**. It also generates a collated “review prompt” you can hand to an LLM agent (or a human) to implement the requested changes.

## Why

- Keep review feedback **in the repo**, versioned, branch-aware, and shareable via `refs/notes/*`.
- Review **staged**, **unstaged**, or **base-branch** diffs without shelling out to `git`.
- Stay in the terminal, with a UI inspired by GitHub/Forgejo review flows.

## Features

- **Two-pane TUI**: file list on the left, diff on the right.
- **Views**
  - `all`: HEAD → worktree (shows combined staged + unstaged result)
  - `staged`: HEAD → index
  - `unstaged`: index → worktree
  - `base`: merge-base(base, HEAD) → HEAD
- **Diff modes** (toggle with `i`)
  - Unified (“stacked”)
  - Side-by-side
- **Per-file syntax highlighting** on diff code lines using `syntastica` + `hyperpolyglot` language detection.
- **Comment markers**: unresolved comments show `💬` and resolved comments show `✓`.
- **Resolve comments**: resolve/unresolve individual comments so your prompt only contains actionable items.
- **Git notes storage**: comments are stored under a notes ref (default: `refs/notes/remark`).
- **Prompt rendering**
  - In TUI: open prompt preview and copy it to clipboard.
  - Headless: `remark prompt …` prints (or copies) the prompt without launching the UI.
- **Clipboard support**
  - Desktop clipboard via `copypasta` (Wayland supported)
  - OSC52 fallback for remote terminals

## Install / Build

This repo is a Rust binary crate.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The resulting binary is:

```bash
target/release/remark
```

## Usage

Run inside a git repository:

```bash
remark
```

Optional flags:

```bash
remark --ref refs/notes/remark --base refs/heads/main
```

- `--ref`: which notes ref to store reviews under (default: `refs/notes/remark`)
- `--base`: base ref used by the “base” view (default: `@{upstream}` then `main`/`master` heuristics)

### Headless prompt output

Render the collated prompt from the stored per-file notes, without starting the TUI:

```bash
remark prompt
```

Options:

```bash
remark prompt --view all
remark prompt --view staged
remark prompt --view unstaged
remark prompt --view base --base refs/heads/main
remark prompt --ref refs/notes/remark
remark prompt --copy
```

## Keybindings

### Global / browse mode

- `Tab` / `Shift-Tab`: switch focus between **Files** and **Diff**
- `1` / `2` / `3` / `4`: switch view **all / unstaged / staged / base**
- `i`: toggle diff mode **unified ↔ side-by-side**
- `↑` / `↓`: move selection (focused pane)
- `PgUp` / `PgDn`: scroll (focused pane)
- `c`: add/edit comment (file header or commentable line)
- `d`: delete comment (file header or commentable line)
- `r`: resolve/unresolve comment
- `Ctrl+S`: save review notes to the configured notes ref
- `p`: toggle prompt preview panel
- `y`: copy prompt to clipboard (when prompt preview is open)
- `q` / `Q`: quit (unsaved changes are discarded unless you saved with `Ctrl+S`)
- `?`: help (press `?` or `Esc` again to close)

### Comment editor

- `Enter`: newline
- `F2` or `Alt+Enter`: accept comment and advance
- `Esc`: cancel editor

Note: many terminals do not reliably distinguish `Shift+Enter` / `Ctrl+Enter`, which is why acceptance uses `F2` / `Alt+Enter`.

## What counts as “commentable”

`remark` supports:

- **File-level comments**: select the file header row at the top of the diff and press `c`.
- **Line comments**:
  - Added/context lines attach to **new** (right) line numbers.
  - Removed lines attach to **old** (left) line numbers.

## Storage model

### Where the review is stored

Reviews are stored as **git notes** under a configurable ref (default `refs/notes/remark`).

Notes are attached to **synthetic object ids** derived from:

- the current `HEAD` commit id
- the selected view (`all`, `staged`, `unstaged`, `base:<ref>`)
- the file path

This means each reviewed file gets its **own note**, and when you create a new commit you naturally get a fresh set of notes for that commit.

### Note contents

Each per-file note is markdown with an embedded JSON block:

- JSON contains:
  - a file-level comment (optional)
  - line comments keyed by `(old|new, 1-based line_number)`

The LLM prompt is generated by collating all per-file notes for the current view; file-level comments are repeated as a TODO list at the end.

## Clipboard behavior

When copying a prompt (`y` in prompt preview, or `remark prompt --copy`):

1. `remark` tries the desktop clipboard via `copypasta` (works on Wayland/X11/macOS/Windows depending on environment).
2. If that fails (common in headless/SSH sessions), it falls back to **OSC52**, which asks your terminal emulator to place the text into your local clipboard.

## Current limitations

- Comments are currently file-level + line-level only; no multi-line / hunk-level comments.
- Comments are anchored to old/new line numbers (they can drift as the diff changes).
- UI styling is intentionally simple (especially around file/hunk headers).

## Implementation notes

Core libraries used:

- `ratatui` + `crossterm` for TUI rendering/input
- `gix` for repository access (status, trees, objects, notes ref updates)
- `gix-diff` for unified diff generation
- `syntastica` + `syntastica-parsers` + `syntastica-themes` for syntax highlighting
- `hyperpolyglot` for language detection
- `copypasta` (desktop clipboard) + OSC52 fallback (remote clipboard-friendly)
